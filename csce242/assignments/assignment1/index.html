        <h1>Fortnite</h1>
        <h2>What is Fortnite?</h2>

        <p>
            Fortnite is a video game that was designed and released by Epic Games in 2017. The video game quickly took over
            the gaming world with its unique twists on a classic battle royale styled game. The game has generated over 26 
            Billion dollars in revenue to date and continues to set records year after year. The community has expanded 
            accross multiple platforms including twitch, youtube, instagram and tiktok making Fortnite one of the biggest
            video games of all time. 
        </p> 

        <p2>
            With all of these accomplishments, Fortnite has also been in the news for other reasons. The company Epic Games 
            agreed in a settlement with the Federal Trade Comission that they used design tricks to trick their users into 
            making accidental purchases on their game. The company has agreed to a $245 million dollar settlement that is to 
            be payed out to players that apply online. The 37 million users that this applies to have been notified via email
            by the FTC on how to recieve their refund. 
        </p2>
