                <h2>What is NotesSimple?</h2>
                <p>NotesSimple is an innovative new app that allows students to actively record their lectures and automatically translate them to notes. The app is designed for students at any level that have access to technology in the classroom. The app uses voice to text technology to log every word that your proffessor says and then creates a transcript of the text. After you are done recording the lecture, the app will scan the entire text file and highlight key words or phrases and separate them into sections. It will then summarize the text and highlight key information that the proffessor emphasizes. A second document will then be produced that has all of your notes for the day in one place. </p>
